  abstract  = {This paper introduces Flexible BFT, a new approach for BFT consensus solution design
               revolving around two pillars, stronger resilience and diversity. The first pillar,
               stronger resilience, involves a new fault model called alive-but-corrupt faults. Alive-but-corrupt
               replicas may arbitrarily deviate from the protocol in an attempt to break safety of
               the protocol. However, if they cannot break safety, they will not try to prevent liveness
               of the protocol. Combining alive-but-corrupt faults into the model, Flexible BFT is
               resilient to higher corruption levels than possible in a pure Byzantine fault model.
               The second pillar, diversity, designs consensus solutions whose protocol transcript
               is used to draw different commit decisions under diverse beliefs. With this separation,
               the same Flexible BFT solution supports synchronous and asynchronous beliefs, as well
               as varying resilience threshold combinations of Byzantine and alive-but-corrupt faults.
               At a technical level, Flexible BFT achieves the above results using two new ideas.
               First, it introduces a synchronous BFT protocol in which only the commit step requires
               to know the network delay bound and thus replicas execute the protocol without any
               synchrony assumption. Second, it introduces a notion called Flexible Byzantine Quorums
               by dissecting the roles of different quorums in existing consensus protocols.},

  abstract   = {The emergence of blockchains has fueled the development of resilient systems that can deal with Byzantine failures due to crashes, bugs, or even malicious behavior. Recently, we have also seen the exploration of sharding in these resilient systems, this to provide the scalability required by very large data-based applications. Unfortunately, current sharded resilient systems all use system-specific specialized approaches toward sharding that do not provide the flexibility of traditional sharded data management systems.To improve on this situation, we fundamentally look at the design of sharded resilient systems. We do so by introducing BYSHARD, a unifying framework for the study of sharded resilient systems. Within this framework, we show how two-phase commit and two-phase locking---two techniques central to providing atomicity and isolation in traditional sharded databases---can be implemented efficiently in a Byzantine environment, this with a minimal usage of costly Byzantine resilient primitives. Based on these techniques, we propose eighteen multi-shard transaction processing protocols. Finally, we practically evaluate these protocols and show that each protocol supports high transaction throughput and provides scalability while each striking its own trade-off between throughput, isolation level, latency, and abort rate. As such, our work provides a strong foundation for the development of ACID-compliant general-purpose and flexible sharded resilient data management systems.},

%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org).Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require "smart-contracts" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks.This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.},

  abstract  = {A major approach to overcoming the performance and scalability limitations of current
               blockchain protocols is to use sharding which is to split the overheads of processing
               transactions among multiple, smaller groups of nodes. These groups work in parallel
               to maximize performance while requiring significantly smaller communication, computation,
               and storage per node, allowing the system to scale to large networks. However, existing
               sharding-based blockchain protocols still require a linear amount of communication
               (in the number of participants) per transaction, and hence, attain only partially
               the potential benefits of sharding. We show that this introduces a major bottleneck
               to the throughput and latency of these protocols. Aside from the limited scalability,
               these protocols achieve weak security guarantees due to either a small fault resiliency
               (e.g., 1/8 and 1/4) or high failure probability, or they rely on strong assumptions
               (e.g., trusted setup) that limit their applicability to mainstream payment systems.
               We propose RapidChain, the first sharding-based public blockchain protocol that is
               resilient to Byzantine faults from up to a 1/3 fraction of its participants, and achieves
               complete sharding of the communication, computation, and storage overhead of processing
               transactions without assuming any trusted setup. RapidChain employs an optimal intra-committee
               consensus algorithm that can achieve very high throughputs via block pipelining, a
               novel gossiping protocol for large blocks, and a provably-secure reconfiguration mechanism
               to ensure robustness. Using an efficient cross-shard transaction verification technique,
               our protocol avoids gossiping transactions to the entire network. Our empirical evaluations
               suggest that RapidChain can process (and confirm) more than 7,300 tx/sec with an expected
               confirmation latency of roughly 8.7 seconds in a network of 4,000 nodes with an overwhelming
               time-to-failure of more than 4,500 years.},

  abstract   = {Recent developments in blockchain technology have inspired innovative new designs
                in resilient distributed and database systems. At their core, these blockchain applications
                typically use Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols to maintain a common state
                across all replicas, even if some replicas are faulty or malicious. Unfortunately,
                existing consensus protocols are not designed to deal with geo-scale deployments in
                which many replicas spread across a geographically large area participate in consensus.To
                address this, we present the Geo-Scale Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus protocol
                (GeoBFT). GeoBFT is designed for excellent scalability by using a topological-aware
                grouping of replicas in local clusters, by introducing parallelization of consensus
                at the local level, and by minimizing communication between clusters. To validate
                our vision of high-performance geo-scale resilient distributed systems, we implement
                GeoBFT in our efficient ResilientDB permissioned blockchain fabric. We show that GeoBFT
                is not only sound and provides great scalability, but also outperforms state-of-the-art
                consensus protocols by a factor of six in geo-scale deployments.},

  abstract  = {Scalability is one of the main roadblocks to business adoption of blockchain systems.
               Despite recent intensive research on using sharding techniques to enhance the scalability
               of blockchain systems, existing solutions do not efficiently address cross-shard transactions.
               In this paper, we introduce SharPer, a scalable permissioned blockchain system. In
               SharPer, nodes are clustered and each data shard is replicated on the nodes of a cluster.
               SharPer supports networks consisting of either crash-only or Byzantine nodes. In SharPer,
               the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph and each cluster maintains
               only a view of the ledger. SharPer incorporates decentralized flattened protocols
               to establish cross-shard consensus. The decentralized nature of the cross-shard consensus
               in SharPer enables parallel processing of transactions with nonoverlapping clusters.
               Furthermore, SharPer provides deterministic safety guarantees. The experimental results
               reveal the efficiency of SharPer in terms of performance and scalability especially
               in workloads with a low percentage of cross-shard transactions.},

abstract = {Within the last few years, a countless number of blockchain systems have emerged on the market, each one claiming to revolutionize the way of distributed transaction processing in one way or the other. Many blockchain features, such as byzantine fault tolerance, are indeed valuable additions in modern environments. However, despite all the hype around the technology, many of the challenges that blockchain systems have to face are fundamental transaction management problems. These are largely shared with traditional database systems, which have been around for decades already. These similarities become especially visible for systems, that blur the lines between blockchain systems and classical database systems. A great example of this is Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source permissioned blockchain system under development by IBM. By implementing parallel transaction processing, Fabric's workflow is highly motivated by optimistic concurrency control mechanisms in classical database systems. This raises two questions: (1)~Which conceptual similarities and differences do actually exist between a system such as Fabric and a classical distributed database system? (2)~Is it possible to improve on the performance of Fabric by transitioning technology from the database world to blockchains and thus blurring the lines between these two types of systems even further? To tackle these questions, we first explore Fabric from the perspective of database research, where we observe weaknesses in the transaction pipeline. We then solve these issues by transitioning well-understood database concepts to Fabric, namely transaction reordering as well as early transaction abort. Our experimental evaluation under the Smallbank benchmark as well as under a custom workload shows that our improved version Fabric++ significantly increases the throughput of successful transactions over the vanilla version by up to a factor of 12x, while decreasing the average latency to almost half.},

abstract = {Permissioned blockchain systems promise to provide both decentralized trust and privacy. Hyperledger Fabric is currently one of the most wide-spread permissioned blockchain systems and is heavily promoted both in industry and academia. Due to its optimistic concurrency model, the transaction failure rates in Fabric can become a bottleneck. While there is active research to reduce failures, there is a lack of understanding on their root cause and, consequently, a lack of guidelines on how to configure Fabric optimally for different scenarios. To close this gap, in this paper, we first introduce a formal definition of the different types of transaction failures in Fabric. Then, we develop a comprehensive testbed and benchmarking system, HyperLedgerLab, along with four different chaincodes that represent realistic use cases and a chaincode/workload generator. Using HyperLedgerLab, we conduct exhaustive experiments to analyze the impact of different parameters of Fabric such as block size, endorsement policies, and others, on transaction failures. We further analyze three recently proposed optimizations from the literature, Fabric++, Streamchain and FabricSharp, and evaluate under which conditions they reduce the failure rates. Finally, based on our results, we provide recommendations for Fabric practitioners on how to configure the system and also propose new research directions.},

abstract = {Smart contracts have enabled blockchain systems to evolve from simple cryptocurrency platforms to general transactional systems. A new architecture called execute-order-validate has been proposed in Hyperledger Fabric to support parallel transactions. However, this architecture might render many invalid transactions when serializing them. This problem is further exaggerated as the block formation rate is inherently limited due to other factors beside data processing, such as cryptography and consensus. Inspired by optimistic concurrency control in modern databases, we propose a novel method to enhance the execute-order-validate architecture, by reordering transactions to reduce the abort rate. In contrast to existing blockchains that adopt database's preventive approaches which might over-abort serializable transactions, our method is theoretically more fine-grained: unserializable transactions are aborted before reordering and the rest are guaranteed to be serializable. We implement our method in two blockchains respectively, FabricSharp on top of Hyperledger Fabric, and FastFabricSharp on top of FastFabric. We compare the performance of FabricSharp with vanilla Fabric and three related systems, two of which are respectively implemented with one standard and one state-of-the-art concurrency control techniques from databases. The results demonstrate that FabricSharp achieves 25% higher throughput compared to the other systems in nearly all experimental scenarios. Moreover, the FastFabricSharp's improvement on FastFabric is up to 66%.},

abstract = {With the increased adaption of blockchain technologies, permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric provide a robust ecosystem for developing production-grade decentralized applications. However, the additional latency between executing and committing transactions, due to Fabric's three-phase transaction lifecycle of Execute-Order-Validate (EOV), is a potential scalability bottleneck. The added latency increases the probability of concurrent updates on the same keys by different transactions, leading to transaction failures caused by Fabric's concurrency control mechanism. The transaction failures increase the application development complexity and decrease Fabric's throughput. Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs) provide a solution for merging and resolving conflicts in the presence of concurrent updates. In this work, we introduce FabricCRDT, an approach for integrating CRDTs to Fabric. Our evaluations show that in general, FabricCRDT offers higher throughput of successful transactions than Fabric, while successfully committing and merging all conflicting transactions without any failures.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art distributed in-memory datastores (FaRM, FaSST, DrTM) provide strongly-consistent distributed transactions with high performance and availability. Transactions in those systems are fully general; they can atomically manipulate any set of objects in the store, regardless of their location. To achieve this, these systems use complex distributed transactional protocols. Meanwhile, many workloads have a high degree of locality. For such workloads, distributed transactions are an overkill as most operations only access objects located on the same server - if sharded appropriately.In this paper, we show that for these workloads, a single-node transactional protocol combined with dynamic object re-sharding and asynchronously pipelined replication can provide the same level of generality with better performance, simpler protocols, and lower developer effort. We present Zeus, an in-memory distributed datastore that provides general transactions by acquiring all objects involved in the transaction to the same server and executing a single-node transaction on them. Zeus is fault-tolerant and strongly-consistent. At the heart of Zeus is a reliable dynamic object sharding protocol that can move 250K objects per second per server, allowing Zeus to process millions of transactions per second and outperform more traditional distributed transactions on a wide range of workloads that exhibit locality.},

Our system calculates optimal placement and decides on object migrations across shards. It supports complex multi-account transactions caused by smart contracts. Placement and migration decisions made by Shard Scheduler are fully deterministic, verifiable, and can be made part of the consensus protocol. Shard Scheduler reduces the number of costly cross-shard transactions, ensures balanced load distribution and maximizes the number of processed transactions for the blockchain as a whole. To this end, it leverages a novel incentive model motivating miners to maximize the global throughput of the entire blockchain rather than the throughput of a specific shard. In our simulations, Shard Scheduler can reduce the number of costly cross-shard transactions by half while ensuring equal load and increasing throughput more than 2 fold when using 60 shards. We also implement and evaluate Shard Scheduler on Chainspace, more than doubling its throughput and reducing user-perceived latency by 70% when using 10 shards.},

abstract = {The scalability problem has been one of the most significant barriers limiting the adoption of blockchains. Blockchain sharding is a promising approach to this problem. However, the sharding mechanism introduces a significant number of cross-shard transactions, which are expensive to process.This paper focuses on the transaction allocation problem to reduce the number of cross-shard transactions for better scalability. In particular, we systematically formulate the transaction allocation problem and convert it to the community detection problem on a graph. A deterministic and fast allocation scheme TxAllo is proposed to dynamically infer the allocation of accounts and their associated transactions. It directly optimizes the system throughput, considering both the number of cross-shard transactions and the workload balance among shards.We evaluate the performance of TxAllo on an Ethereum dataset containing over 91 million transactions. Our evaluation results show that for a blockchain with 60 shards, TxAllo reduces the cross-shard transaction ratio from 98% (by using traditional hash-based allocation) to about 12%. In the meantime, the workload balance is well maintained. Compared with other methods, the execution time of TxAllo is almost negligible. For example, when updating the allocation every hour, the execution of TxAllo only takes 0.5 seconds on average, whereas other concurrent works, such as BrokerChain (INFOCOM’22) leveraging the classic METIS method, require 422 seconds.},

Many distributed ledgers have adopted this approach to increase their performance, however, they focus on the permissionless setting that assumes the existence of a strong adversary. In this paper, we deploy channels for permissioned blockchains. Our first contribution is to adapt sharding on asset-management applications for the permissioned setting, while preserving liveness and safety even on transactions spanning across-channels. Our second contribution is to leverage channels as a confidentiality boundary, enabling different organizations and consortia to preserve their privacy within their channels and still be part of a bigger collaborative ecosystem.

abstract = {A distributed database utilizing the wide-spread edge computing servers to provide low-latency data access with the serializability guarantee is highly desirable for emerging edge computing applications. In an edge database, nodes are divided into regions, and a transaction can be categorized as intra-region (IRT) or cross-region (CRT) based on whether it accesses data in different regions. In addition to serializability, we insist that a practical edge database should provide low tail latency for both IRTs and CRTs, and such low latency must be scalable to a large number of regions. Unfortunately, none of existing geo-replicated serializable databases or edge databases can meet such requirements.In this paper, we present Dast (Decentralized Anticipate and STretch), the first edge database that can meet the stringent performance requirements with serializability. Our key idea is to order transactions by anticipating when they are ready to execute: Dast binds an IRT to the latest timestamp and binds a CRT to a future timestamp to avoid the coordination of CRTs blocking IRTs. Dast also carries a new stretchable clock abstraction to tolerate inaccurate anticipations and to handle cross-region data reads. Our evaluation shows that, compared to three relevant serializable databases, Dast's 99-percentile latency was 87.9\%~93.2\% lower for IRTs and 27.7\%~70.4\% lower for CRTs; Dast's low latency is scalable to a large number of regions.},

DPaxos targets the unique opportunities of utilizing edge computing resources to support emerging applications with stringent mobility and real-time requirements such as Augmented and Virtual Reality and vehicular applications. The main objective of DPaxos is to reduce the latency of serving user requests, recovering from failures, and reacting to mobility. DPaxos achieves these objectives by a few proposed changes to the traditional Paxos protocol. Most notably, DPaxos proposes a dynamic allocation of quorums ( i.e. , groups of nodes) that are needed for Paxos Leader Election. Leader Election quorums in DPaxos are smaller than traditional Paxos and expand only in the presence of conflicts.},

WPaxos uses multileaders, and partitions the object-space among these multileaders. Unlike statically partitioned multiple Paxos deployments, WPaxos is able to adapt to the changing access locality through object stealing. Multiple concurrent leaders coinciding in different zones steal ownership of objects from each other using phase-1 of Paxos, and then use phase-2 to commit update-requests on these objects locally until they are stolen by other leaders. To achieve fast phase-2 commits, WPaxos adopts the flexible quorums idea in a novel manner, and appoints phase-2 acceptors to be close to their respective leaders. We implemented WPaxos and evaluated it over WAN deployments across 5 AWS regions. The dynamic partitioning of the object-space and emphasis on zone-local commits allow WPaxos to significantly outperform both partitioned Paxos deployments and leaderless Paxos approaches.},

abstract = {This study aims to understand the changes in behavior over time of users on Venmo, an American social payments platform. As there is a dearth of replication studies in social media studies, we chose to replicate an existing study of Venmo using new data we collected. This enabled us to track the growth of Venmo from the beginning of the platform, and to verify the robustness of the existing, very limited literature using Venmo data. To accomplish this, we studied how the structure of the transaction graph of Venmo transactions changed since 2016, the data endpoint of previous research. Additionally, we collected a much larger set of data and examined if new community structures or network-level features emerged since 2016. Although we found that Venmo's growth has maintained a similar pattern within its transaction graph and community structure, we discovered some changes, such as the existence of more communities of a smaller size and an increase towards users quitting the platform after one transaction versus becoming regular users. Ultimately, our study confirms both the methods and results of previous work on Venmo, opening up the possibility for future work to study if changes unfold in the next era of the platform. We argue that this replication study serves as an intervention in the field of social media research more broadly, and encourage others to take up replication studies to enhance the reliability and generalized knowledge of the field.},

abstract = {Many mobile and pervasive applications avail cloud services to reduce overheads in on-device computation. The performance of these services depends on the available bandwidth of the underlying network, the physical proximity of the cloud server and the end devices, the volume of data, the computational capacity of the server, and, importantly, the mobility of the devices hosting the applications. Edge computing promises to provide better performance by bringing services (e.g., a video streaming service) from the cloud to servers near the user. It also enables partial or full offloading of the computation (tasks) and storage functionalities from the User Equipment (UE) to the edge of the network. This saves power and benefits from relatively more powerful devices at the edge. Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), which supports wireless and wired access technologies, has gained significant research interest. When UEs move, services must continue to operate, tasks may need to be offloaded again, and states related to tasks and services may need to be migrated. In this paper, we focus on four functional components (task/service offloading, resource allocation, content/task caching, and service/task migration) of MEC. We survey the challenges to these and their solutions in the context of UE mobility. Mobility creates challenges during offloading resource-intensive tasks as the user may move while the task is being offloaded. Some of the other challenges are how to jointly allocate computing and communication resources, minimize service down time during migration, and share the backhaul network if the same MEC host must continue to be used. Some key research areas include intelligent task offloading and service migration algorithms, exploiting group mobility to improve task migration time, studying the interplay of MEC parameters such as capabilities of the target MEC host, etc. In addition, predicting the mobile trajectory through intelligent methods and implementations with datasets from real-world scenarios are required. We compare this paper on 11 parameters (service migration, task offloading, resource allocation, content caching, mobility, use cases, architecture, computing paradigm, mobility model, system model, virtualization/Software Defined Networks) with 31 other survey papers from 2018 to April 2022 in MEC and related domains. We discuss the Edge Computing paradigm, the system architecture and model descriptions, and use cases. We briefly explain the relevant challenges and future directions in emerging domains, such as the Internet of drones and Digital twins. We also discuss future research directions in task/service migration, offloading, resource management, distributed computing, reliability, and Quality of Service, all related to mobility in MEC.}

Basil leverages ACID transactions to scalably implement the abstraction of a trusted shared log in the presence of Byzantine actors. Unlike traditional BFT approaches, Basil executes non-conflicting operations in parallel and commits transactions in a single round-trip during fault-free executions. Basil improves throughput over traditional BFT systems by four to five times, and is only four times slower than TAPIR, a non-Byzantine replicated system. Basil's novel recovery mechanism further minimizes the impact of failures: with 30\% Byzantine clients, throughput drops by less than 25\% in the worst-case.},

SLOG achieves high-throughput, strictly serializable ACID transactions at geo-replicated distance and scale for all transactions submitted across the world, all the while achieving low latency for transactions that initiate from a location close to the home region for data they access. Experiments find that SLOG can reduce latency by more than an order of magnitude relative to state-of-the-art strictly serializable geo-replicated database systems such as Spanner and Calvin, while maintaining high throughput under contention.},

abstract = { Recently, a number of researchers have investigated a class of graph partitioning algorithms that reduce the size of the graph by collapsing vertices and edges, partition the smaller graph, and then uncoarsen it to construct a partition for the original graph [Bui and Jones, Proc. of the 6th SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing, 1993, 445--452; Hendrickson and Leland, A Multilevel Algorithm for Partitioning Graphs, Tech. report SAND 93-1301, Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM, 1993]. From the early work it was clear that multilevel techniques held great promise; however, it was not knownif they can be made to consistently produce high quality partitions for graphs arising in a wide range of application domains. We investigate the effectiveness of many different choices for all three phases: coarsening, partition of the coarsest graph, and refinement. In particular, we present a new coarsening heuristic (called heavy-edge heuristic) for which the size of the partition of the coarse graph is within a small factor of the size of the final partition obtained after multilevel refinement. We also present a much faster variation of the Kernighan--Lin (KL) algorithm for refining during uncoarsening. We test our scheme on a large number of graphs arising in various domains including finite element methods, linear programming, VLSI, and transportation. Our experiments show that our scheme produces partitions that are consistently better than those produced by spectral partitioning schemes in substantially smaller time. Also, when our scheme is used to compute fill-reducing orderings for sparse matrices, it produces orderings that have substantially smaller fill than the widely used multiple minimum degree algorithm. }

abstract = {Blockchain is an incrementally updated ledger maintained by distributed nodes with excellent features such as decentralization and immutability. However, the development of blockchain is now limited due to storage redundancy. Specifically, nodes cannot afford to store a large amount of data, and the mechanism of setting many ordinary nodes as light nodes sacrifices the most important decentralization feature of the blockchain. This paper proposes the SSChain sharding scheme, which reduces the storage burden of each node on the blockchain without losing the decentralization feature. First, we shard the state in the blockchain through the data structure of Merkle DAG; then, shard all nodes in the blockchain through DHT technology; finally, store the state in the blockchain in different Node and establish a mapping relationship. With this scheme, each node only needs to store the state data allocated to it by the storage system, and can obtain other state data it needs from other nodes. After experimentation, the solution of this paper is feasible. The performance of storage is better than other current solutions, and the scalability of the blockchain is improved.},

abstract = {Sharding is a promising approach to high-performance blockchains and has been extensively explored in academia recently. However, sharding also introduces cross-shard transactions, which require expensive inter-shard coordination to ensure state consistency. Such transactions significantly limit the performance of sharded blockchains.To reduce cross-shard transactions in UTXO-based sharded blockchains, we propose Rooted Graph Placement, which identifies the most appropriate shard for a transaction based on the interaction between the transaction and historical transactions. In conjunction with the placement algorithm, we also devise two techniques to lessen the system performance impact of the remaining cross-shard transactions. One technique parallelizes dependent transaction verification with the atomic commit protocol, and the other consolidates the atomic commit protocol. Combining all the three techniques, we can improve the maximum system throughput by 118\% when compared with a state-of-the-art transaction placement algorithm.},

abstract = {Sharding is widely used to scale an application. Despite a decade of effort to build generic sharding frameworks that can be reused across different applications, the extent of their success remains unclear. We attempt to answer a fundamental question: what barriers prevent a sharding framework from getting adopted by the majority of sharded applications?We analyze hundreds of sharded applications at Facebook and identify two major barriers: 1) lack of support for geo-distributed applications, which account for most of Facebook's applications, and 2) inability to maintain application availability during planned events such as software upgrades, which happen ≈1000 times more frequently than unplanned failures. A sharding framework that does not help applications to address these fundamental challenges is not sufficiently attractive for most applications to adopt it. Other adoption barriers include the burden of supporting many complex applications in a one-size-fit-all sharding framework and the difficulty in supporting sophisticated shard-placement requirements. Theoretically, a constraint solver can handle complex placement requirements, but in practice it is not scalable enough to perform near-realtime shard placement at a global scale.We have overcome these adoption barriers in Facebook's sharding framework called Shard Manager. Currently, Shard Manager is used by hundreds of applications running on over one million machines, which account for about 54\% of all sharded applications at Facebook.},

abstract="With the advance in technology and growth in standard of living, smart homes have become a reality. Smart homes consist of home appliances and devices that communicate with each other to address the needs of the residents. These appliances generate, share and consume lots of data which are private and sometimes safety critical to the residents. Managing them is a challenging task. The current frameworks for managing home appliances are centralized in nature. Such frameworks force smart home residents to trust the service providers or a third party. These frameworks are also prone to hacking, compromise of data and a single point of failure. Availability of services can also never be guaranteed with such frameworks. Technologies such as blockchain and smart contracts can help to manage these appliances. In this paper, we study the scope of blockchain technology in smart homes. We propose, implement and evaluate a blockchain based approach using Proof-of-Authority as the consensus mechanism for managing appliances in smart homes. In addition, we compare the performance of our system with the traditional Proof-of-Work based system.",

abstract = {We propose separating the task of reliable transaction dissemination from transaction ordering, to enable high-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant quorum-based consensus. We design and evaluate a mempool protocol, Narwhal, specializing in high-throughput reliable dissemination and storage of causal histories of transactions. Narwhal tolerates an asynchronous network and maintains high performance despite failures. Narwhal is designed to easily scale-out using multiple workers at each validator, and we demonstrate that there is no foreseeable limit to the throughput we can achieve.Composing Narwhal with a partially synchronous consensus protocol (Narwhal-HotStuff) yields significantly better throughput even in the presence of faults or intermittent loss of liveness due to asynchrony. However, loss of liveness can result in higher latency. To achieve overall good performance when faults occur we design Tusk, a zero-message overhead asynchronous consensus protocol, to work with Narwhal. We demonstrate its high performance under a variety of configurations and faults.As a summary of results, on a WAN, Narwhal-Hotstuff achieves over 130,000 tx/sec at less than 2-sec latency compared with 1,800 tx/sec at 1-sec latency for Hotstuff. Additional workers increase throughput linearly to 600,000 tx/sec without any latency increase. Tusk achieves 160,000 tx/sec with about 3 seconds latency. Under faults, both protocols maintain high throughput, but Narwhal-HotStuff suffers from increased latency.},

abstract = {We present Bullshark, the first directed acyclic graph (DAG) based asynchronous Byzantine Atomic Broadcast protocol that is optimized for the common synchronous case. Like previous DAG-based BFT protocols [19, 25], Bullshark requires no extra communication to achieve consensus on top of building the DAG. That is, parties can totally order the vertices of the DAG by interpreting their local view of the DAG edges. Unlike other asynchronous DAG-based protocols, Bullshark provides a practical low latency fast-path that exploits synchronous periods and deprecates the need for notoriously complex view-change and view-synchronization mechanisms. Bullshark achieves this while maintaining all the desired properties of its predecessor DAG-Rider [25]. Namely, it has optimal amortized communication complexity, it provides fairness and asynchronous liveness, and safety is guaranteed even under a quantum adversary.In order to show the practicality and simplicity of our approach, we also introduce a standalone partially synchronous version of Bullshark, which we evaluate against the state of the art. The implemented protocol is embarrassingly simple (200 LOC on top of an existing DAG-based mempool implementation). It is highly efficient, achieving for example, 125,000 transactions per second with a 2 seconds latency for a deployment of 50 parties. In the same setting, the state of the art pays a steep 50\% latency increase as it optimizes for asynchrony.},

PoA has been widely adopted by communities and industries due to its better performance and faster finality. In this paper, we explore the unfairness issue existing in the current PoA implementations. We have investigated 2,500+ in the wild projects and selected 10+ as our main focus (covering Ethereum, Binance smart chain, etc.). We have identified two types of order manipulation attacks to separately break the transaction-level (a.k.a. transaction ordering) and the block-level (sealer position ordering) fairness. Both of them merely rely on honest-but-profitable sealer assumption without modifying original settings. We launch these attacks on the forked branches under an isolated environment and carefully evaluate the attacking scope towards different implementations. To date (as of Nov 2021), the potentially affected PoA market cap can reach up to 681,087 million USD. Besides, we further dive into the source code of selected projects, and accordingly, propose our recommendation for the fix. To the best of knowledge, this work provides the first exploration of the unfairness issue in PoA algorithms.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting the world’s connectivity landscape. More and more IoT devices are connected, bringing many benefits to our daily lives. However, the influx of IoT devices poses non-trivial challenges for the existing cloud-based computing paradigm. In the cloud-based architecture, a large amount of IoT data is transferred to the cloud for data management, analysis, and decision making. It could not only cause a heavy workload on the cloud but also result in unacceptable network latency, ultimately undermining the benefits of cloud-based computing. To address these challenges, researchers are looking for new computing models for the IoT. Edge computing, a new decentralized computing model, is valued by more and more researchers in academia and industry. The main idea of edge computing is placing data processing in near-edge devices instead of remote cloud servers. It is promising to build more scalable, low-latency IoT systems. Many studies have been proposed on edge computing and IoT, but a comprehensive survey of this crossover area is still lacking.In this survey, we first introduce the impact of edge computing on the development of IoT and point out why edge computing is more suitable for IoT than other computing paradigms. Then, we analyze the necessity of systematical investigation on the edge-computing-driven IoT (ECDriven-IoT) and summarize new challenges occurring in ECDriven-IoT. We categorize recent advances from bottom to top, covering six aspects of ECDriven-IoT. Finally, we conclude lessons learned and propose some challenging},

ABSTRACT = {A blockchain has been applied in many areas, such as cryptocurrency, smart cities and digital finance. The consensus protocol is the core part of the blockchain network, which addresses the problem of transaction consistency among the involved participants. However, the scalability, efficiency and security of the consensus protocol are greatly restricted with the increasing number of nodes. A Hierarchy Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus protocol (HBFT) based on node reputation has been proposed. The two-layer hierarchy structure is designed to improve the scalability by assigning nodes to different layers. Each node only needs to exchange messages within its group, which deducts the communication complexity between nodes. Specifically, a reputation model is proposed to distinguish normal nodes from malicious ones by a punish and reward mechanism. It is applied to ensure that the malicious node merely existing in the bottom layer and the communication complexity in the high layer can be further lowered. Finally, a random selection mechanism is applied in the selection of the leader node. The mechanism can ensure the security of the blockchain network with the characteristics of unpredictability and randomicity. Some experimental results demonstrated that the proposed consensus protocol has excellent performance in comparison to some state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract   = {Blockchain databases have attracted widespread attention but suffer from poor scalability due to underlying non-scalable blockchains. While blockchain sharding is necessary for a scalable blockchain database, it poses a new challenge named on-chain cross-shard database services. Each cross-shard database service (e.g., cross-shard queries or inter-shard load balancing) involves massive cross-shard data exchanges, while the existing cross-shard mechanisms need to process each cross-shard data exchange via the consensus of all nodes in the related shards (i.e., on-chain) to resist a Byzantine environment of blockchain, which eliminates sharding benefits.To tackle the challenge, this paper presents GriDB, the first scalable blockchain database, by designing a novel off-chain cross-shard mechanism for efficient cross-shard database services. Borrowing the idea of off-chain payments, GriDB delegates massive cross-shard data exchange to a few nodes, each of which is randomly picked from a different shard. Considering the Byzantine environment, the untrusted delegates cooperate to generate succinct proof for cross-shard data exchanges, while the consensus is only responsible for the low-cost proof verification. However, different from payments, the database services' verification has more requirements (e.g., completeness, correctness, freshness, and availability); thus, we introduce several new authenticated data structures (ADS). Particularly, we utilize consensus to extend the threat model and reduce the complexity of traditional accumulator-based ADS for verifiable cross-shard queries with a rich set of relational operators. Moreover, we study the necessity of inter-shard load balancing for a scalable blockchain database and design an off-chain and live approach for both efficiency and availability during balancing. An evaluation of our prototype shows the performance of GriDB in terms of scalability in workloads with queries and updates.},

abstract = {Leader-based Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols used by permissioned blockchains have limited scalability and robustness. To alleviate the leader bottleneck in BFT consensus, we introduce Stratus, a robust shared mempool protocol that decouples transaction distribution from consensus. Our idea is to have replicas disseminate transactions in a distributed manner and have the leader only propose transaction ids. Stratus uses a provably available broadcast (PAB) protocol to ensure the availability of the referenced transactions. To deal with unbalanced load across replicas, Stratus adopts a distributed load balancing protocol.We implemented and evaluated Stratus by integrating it with state-of-the-art BFT-based blockchain protocols. Our evaluation of these protocols in both LAN and WAN settings shows that Stratus-based protocols achieve 5× to 20× higher throughput than their native counterparts in a network with hundreds of replicas. In addition, the performance of Stratus degrades gracefully in the presence of network asynchrony, Byzantine attackers, and unbalanced workloads.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has emerged as the cornerstone of many decentralized applications operating among otherwise untrusted peers. However, it is well known that existing blockchain systems do not scale well. Transactions are often executed and committed sequentially in order to maintain the same view of the total order. Furthermore, it is necessary to duplicate both transaction data and their executions in every node in the blockchain network for integrity assurance. Such storage and computation requirements put significant burdens on the blockchain system, not only limiting system scalability but also undermining system security and robustness by making the network more centralized. To tackle these problems, in this paper, we propose SlimChain, a novel blockchain system that scales transactions through off-chain storage and parallel processing. Advocating a stateless design, SlimChain maintains only the short commitments of ledger states on-chain while dedicating transaction executions and data storage to off-chain nodes. To realize SlimChain, we propose new schemes for off-chain smart contract execution, on-chain transaction validation, and state commitment. We also propose optimizations to reduce network transmissions and a new sharding technique to improve system scalability further. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed SlimChain system. Compared with the existing systems, SlimChain reduces the on-chain storage requirements by 97\% ~ 99\%, while also improving the peak throughput by 1.4\texttimes{} ~ 15.6\texttimes{}.},

With the continuous increase of business scale, the performance of a single blockchain is difficult to meet the demand and sharding is considered as a potential technology that can solve the problem. However, existing sharding protocols either process transactions only on a subset of blockchain nodes or needs to modify consensus algorithm, making the protocols difficult to apply in enterprise blockchain systems. In this paper, we propose PShard, a practical sharding protocol for enterprise blockchain. PShard adopts a two-layer data model for sharded enterprise blockchain where each enterprise participates in every shard and uses a two-phase method to execute cross-shard transactions to guarantee the safety and liveness of the protocol. We implement a prototype of enterprise blockchain system based on PShard and evaluate it in the experiments. The experimental results show that the performance of the system grows linearly as the number of shards increases.},

Scalability is one of the main problems that limit its usage. This paper introduces a full sharding protocol, Geochain, for permissioned blockchains. We first clarify the limitations of state-of-the-art sharding protocols. Then, we propose a locality-based sharding protocol that achieves high scalability. We optimize inter-shard performance by clustering participants using their geographical properties, locality. In addition, the locality is also employed to decide the transaction placement which results in a low ratio of cross-shard transactions for applications, such as everyday banking, retail payments, and electric vehicle charging. We also propose a client-driven efficient mechanism to handle cross-shard transactions and present an analysis. This enables clients to manage their assets across different shards directly. A prototype is implemented on top of Hyperledger Fabric v2.3 and evaluated on Amazon EC2. The experiments show that our protocol doubles the peak throughput, even with a high ratio of cross-shard transactions, while minimizing the transaction latency.},

Reconstructed blockchain systems have been proposed to avoid the consumption of competitive transactions caused by linear sequenced blocks. These systems, instead, structure transactions/blocks in the form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and consequently rebuild upper layer components. The promise of DAG-based blockchain systems is to enable fast confirmation (complete transactions within million seconds) and high scalability (attach transactions in parallel) without significantly compromising security. However, this field still lacks systematic work that summarises DAG techniques. To bridge the gap, this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) provides a comprehensive analysis of ever-existing and ongoing DAG-based blockchain systems. We abstract a general model to capture the main features and identify six types of design patterns. Then, we evaluate these systems from the perspectives of structure, consensus, property, security, and performance. We further discuss the trade-off between different factors, open challenges, and the potentiality of DAG-based solutions, indicating their promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {To overcome the scaling and performance limitations, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is utilized as the underlying storage model of blockchain systems, which enables concurrent transaction processing and confirmation. However, accompanied by high performance, DAG-based blockchains still suffer from the severe challenge of constrained storage scalability, i.e., expensive storage overhead. Based on an in-depth analysis of the data, we discover that the root cause of storage overhead stems from the considerable data redundancy in the DAG-based blockchains. In this paper, we propose GeckoDAG, a lightweight DAG-based blockchain, whose design consists of two steps. First, we abstract a storage model named Basic from the existing DAG-based blockchain systems, which offers both high performance and security. On top of Basic, we then devise GeckoDAG, which merges previous transactions into Transaction Union (TU) and reduces the data redundancy in TU, thus lowering the storage overhead. To evaluate our design, we implement a prototype of GeckoDAG and conduct various experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that GeckoDAG can offer storage scalability while maintaining the security and efficiency of DAG-based blockchains.},

abstract = {Many applications, e.g., digital twins, rely on sensing data from Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which is used to infer event(s) and initiate actions to affect an environment. This gives rise to concerns relating to data integrity and provenance. One possible solution to address these concerns is to employ blockchain. However, blockchain has high resource requirements, thereby making it unsuitable for use on resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, this paper proposes a novel approach, called two-layer directed acyclic graph (2LDAG), whereby IoT devices only store a digital fingerprint of data generated by their neighbors. Further, it proposes a novel proof-of-path (PoP) protocol that allows an operator or digital twin to verify data in an on-demand manner. The simulation results show 2LDAG has storage and communication cost that is respectively two and three orders of magnitude lower than traditional blockchain and also blockchains that use a DAG structure. Moreover, 2LDAG achieves consensus even when 49% of nodes are malicious.},

  abstract  = {The number of fake news written by bots or malicious actors on social media is rising. One cause is the ability of users to post anything, at any place, at any time. This offers great flexibility, but it also poses the risk that users share misinformation. One type includes events that allegedly have occurred in a location, without the reporting user necessarily having been present. A user may add her location to posts to appear as an eyewitness and thus more trustworthy; however, basing that trust on commonly used and easily faked GPS locations is not reasonable.We present EventChain, which enriches social media posts with hard to fake trust scores based on the user's recent motion profile to give actual eyewitnesses more credibility. Users' motion profiles are integrity- and privacy-preservingly logged in a blockchain. Once the user posts an event, her locality is evaluated for a location rating. The location evaluation is secured by a trusted execution environment to ensure users' location data is private and under the users' control at all times. EventChain also enables interactive assessments of a post via nearby users, whose location is similarly evaluated. This way other eyewitnesses can credibly provide further information, thus leading to a consensus about the event's actual occurrences, increasing trust in social media posts, and limiting the spread of fake news.},

abstract = {A fundamental issue in blockchain systems is their scalability in terms of data storage, computation, communication, and security. To resolve this issue, a promising research direction is coding theory, which is widely used for distributed storage, recovery from erasures or channel errors and/or to reduce communication cost. To this end, this article provides the first comprehensive survey of approaches that employ coding theory to scale blockchain systems. It shows how the use of coded symbols or shards allow participants to only store a fraction of the total blockchain, protect against malicious nodes or erasures, ensure data availability in order to promote transparency, and scale the security of sharded blockchains. Further, coded symbols help reduce communication cost when disseminating blocks, which help bootstrap new nodes and speed up consensus of blocks. For each category of solutions, we highlight problems and issues that motivated their designs and use of coding. Moreover, we provide a qualitative analysis of their storage, communication, and computation costs.},
